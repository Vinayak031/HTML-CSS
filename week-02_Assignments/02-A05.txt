    What is Emmet?
        Emmet (formerly Zen Coding) is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in
        HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist. The project was started by Vadim Makeev
        in 2008 and continues to be actively developed by Sergey Chikuyonok and Emmet users. Since 2015, Mikael
        Geletsyan is responsible for UX at Emmet. The tools have been incorporated into several popular text editors, as
        well as some plug-ins developed by the Emmet team and others implemented independently. However, Emmet is
        primarily independent from any text editor, as the engine works directly with text rather than with any
        particular software.
    ->Advantages of Emmet Software:
        Benefits of using Emmet with HTML: The main benefit of using Emmet with HTML is increased productivity and faster
        coding. Emmet's shorthand notation allows developers to write code quickly and efficiently, and the plugin's
        expanding capabilities ensure that the code is valid and properly formatted.</p>
