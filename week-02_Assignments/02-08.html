    <dl><b>HTML</b></dl>
    <dd>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web
        applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
        <br><br>
        <b>Hyper Text:</b> HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext.
        Whenever you
        click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link
        two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
        <br><br>
        <b>Markup language:</b> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting
        conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into
        images, tables, links, etc.
        <br><br>
        <b>Web Page:</b> A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A
        web page
        can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML
        only, we can create static web pages.

    <dl><b>CSS</b></dl>
    <dd>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and
        formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally
        used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML
        documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.<br />
        <br>
        CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and
        user interfaces for many mobile applications.

    <dl><b>JavaScript</b></dl>
    <dd>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for
        scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
        interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding
        programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other
        graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without
        reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and
        simplicity.<br>
        <br>
        Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in
        the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB
        and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.

    <dl><b>React</b></dl>
    <dd>
        ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is
        an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the
        application. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp
        & Instagram.
        <br><br>
        Our ReactJS tutorial includes all the topics which help to learn ReactJS. These are ReactJS Introduction,
        ReactJS Features, ReactJS Installation, Pros and Cons of ReactJS, ReactJS JSX, ReactJS Components, ReactJS
        State, ReactJS Props, ReactJS Forms, ReactJS Events, ReactJS Animation and many more.

    <dl><b>ExpressJS</b></dl>
    <dd>Express is a fast, assertive, essential and moderate web framework of Node.js. You can assume express as a layer
        built on the top of the Node.js that helps manage a server and routes. It provides a robust set of features to
        develop web and mobile applications.
        <br><br>
        Let's see some of the core features of Express framework:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>It can be used to design single-page, multi-page and hybrid web applications.</li>
            <li>It allows to setup middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.</li>
            <li>It defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP method and URL.</li>
            <li>It allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <dl><b>Django</b></dl>
    <dd>
        Django is a web application framework written in Python programming language. It is based on MVT (Model View
        Template) design pattern. The Django is very demanding due to its rapid development feature. It takes less time
        to build application after collecting client requirement.
        <br><br>

        This framework uses a famous tag line:The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.
        <br><br>
        By using Django, we can build web applications in very less time. Django is designed in such a manner that it
        handles much of configure things automatically, so we can focus on application development only.
