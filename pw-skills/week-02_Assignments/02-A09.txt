1)Self-closing tags:

HTML tags that do not require a closing tag. They are used for elements that do not contain any content
or do not require a closing tag for proper functionality. Instead, they are written with a trailing slash
before the closing angle bracket (/>).

Example of a self-closing tag: <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />

2)Meta Tags:

Meta tags in HTML are used to provide metadata or additional information about an HTML document.
They are placed within the

<head> section of an HTML document and do not produce any visible
    content on the webpage. Meta tags are used by search engines, browsers and other applications
    to understand and process information about the webpage.

    Examples:

    1)
    <meta charset="UTF-8">:
    This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. UTF-8 is widely used and
    supports a wide range of characters from various languages.

    2)
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:
    This meta tag is used for responsive web design. It sets the viewport width and initial zoom level,
    ensuring proper display and scaling on different devices.

    3)
    <meta name="description" content="A brief description of the webpage">:
    This meta tag provides a brief description of the webpage's content. It is often used by search engines
