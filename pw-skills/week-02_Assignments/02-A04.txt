some of the html tags:
    1.span tag:
    The span HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent
        anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because
        they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.
        span is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a span is an inline-level
        element.

    2.Audio tag:
    The audio HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources,
        represented using the src attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can
        also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.

    3.Video tag:
    The video HTML element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use video
        for audio content as well, but the audio element may provide a more appropriate user experience.
