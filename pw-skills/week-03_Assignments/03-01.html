            <h3>Controversies</h3>
            On March 21 2023, several prominent and established teachers at the ed-tech company alleged that their
            vision of the company is being disillusioned and in response started an independent YouTube channel by
            the
            name, 'Sankalp'. They said that their resignation at PW was because of the atmosphere at the company and
            that at the Kota centre of PW, students were not getting the quality education worth their tuition fee.
            <br><br>
            In response, a teacher of the company, Pankaj Sijairya, alleged in a video that the three ex-PW teachers
            â€“
            Tarun Kumar, Manish Dubey, and Sarvesh Dixit were offered INR 5 Cr each to resign from Physics Wallah
            andjoin the rival company, Adda247. The three teachers, in a video claimed that Pankaj Sijairya falsely
            accused
            them of accepting bribes from rival platform Adda247.
